Hello!

This is my first project written for Android, you can check it and download it from link available above.
Sorry for the quality of code, I was developing this app with MVP (minimum viable product) methodology. 

I hope that this application will be helpful in case of doubts about mountain trip, or even save someone health or life.
Always be aware that mountains are highly unpredictable.

However, I've few ideas how to expand this app:

TODO:
1. Add temperature parsing from http://www.test.tatrynet.pl/pogoda/weatherMiddleware_v1.0/xml/lokalizacje1.xml and place them at the views. 
2. Implement Tatra mountains area weather forecast for new tab.
3. Implement image cache system to prevent TOPR servers from exhausting.

DONE:

Fixed problem with scaling images at FHD (and above) screens.
Fixed problem with loading corrupted images from TOPR servers (unfortunately this happens very often)

Maybe you will find some free time to contribute?
Best, Kris
